Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

Both Dockerfiles are created inside each folder, specifying the location in the Dockerfile and when executing the build eg: docker build -f node-app/Dockerfile .


2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

Node:
docker build -f node-app/Dockerfile .

Python:
docker build -f python-app/Dockerfile .


3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

Node:
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name node-assingmnet containerID

Python:
docker run -d -i --name python-assignment containerID


4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

docker rmi ...names


5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

Node:
docker build -t assignment-node:1 -f node-app/Dockerfile .

Python:
docker build -t assignment-python:1 -f python-app/Dockerfile .


6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.

Node:
docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --name node-assignment containerID
docker stop node-assignment

Python:
docker run -d -i --name python-assignment containerID
